This decision of the Commission \\nwas challenged by 11 candidates by filing \\na writ petition in this Court which was \\ndismissed. The Supreme Court however \\ngranted relief to them by directing that \\nthey shall be considered by the \\nCommission and the State Government, \\nand would be appointed if otherwise \\nfound suitable and eligible. The said \\ndecision was rendered in Sheo Shyam & \\nOrs. Vs. State of U.P. & Ors., (2004) 2 \\nESC 256. The Supreme Court in the said \\ndecision held that the life of the waiting \\nlist which is of one year should be \\nreckoned from the last date when the \\nrecommendation was made by the State \\nGovernment. However, in view of the fact \\nthat after the decision of the Commission \\nnot to send the names to the State \\nGovernment as the waiting list had \\nexpired, which decision was the subject \\nmatter of the writ petition before the High \\nCourt, the State Government itself had \\nsent a requisition of 56 posts, including 11 \\nposts to which the dispute related, and \\nexaminations were held subsequently on \\n9th November, 2003, the Supreme Court \\nobserved that the career of 11 candidates \\ncannot be jeopardised, and therefore in \\nthese peculiar circumstances, it directed \\nthat the appointment shall be considered \\nby the Commission and the State \\nGovernment.  \\n \\n3.  Learned counsel for the \\npetitioners submitted that the same relief \\nshould be granted to the petitioners. From \\na perusal of the judgment of the Supreme \\nCourt we find that because of the peculiar \\nfacts and circumstances of the case that \\nthe Supreme Court had granted relief to \\nthe 11 appellants only. The Supreme \\nCourt could have granted relief to all the \\ncandidates in the waiting list subject to \\nthe availability of the vacancies.  \\n \\n4.  In the State of Kerla Vs. Kumari \\nT.P. Roshana & Ors., AIR 1979 SC 765, \\nthe Hon\\'ble Supreme Court considered \\nthis aspect and observed as under:-  \\n \\n\"The root of the grievance and the \\nfruit of the writ are not individual but \\ncollective and while the \\'\\'adversary \\nsystem\\' makes the Judge a mere umpire, \\ntraditionally speaking, the community \\norientation of the judicial function, so \\ndesirable in the Third World remedial \\njurisprudence, transforms the Court\\'s \\npower into affirmative structuring of \\nredress so as to make it personally \\nmeaningful and socially relevant. \\nFrustration of invalidity is part of the \\njudicial duty; fulfilment of legality is \\ncomplementary. Selection of these thirty \\nstudents will not be confined to those who \\nhave moved this Court or the High Court \\nby way of writ petition or appeal. The \\nmeasure is academic excellence, not \\nlitigating persistence. It will be thrown \\nopen to the first thirty strictly according to \\nmerit measure by marks secured.\"  \\n \\n5.  The same view has been \\nexpressed by the Apex Court in Ajay \\nHasia & Ors. Vs. Khalid Mujib \\nSehravardi & Ors., AIR 1981 SC 487; and \\nPunjab Engineering College, Chandigarh \\nVs. Sanjay Gulati & Ors., AIR 1983 SC \\n580. In Thaper Institute of Engineering & \\nTechnology, Patiala Vs. Abhinav Taneja \\n& Ors., (1990) 3 SCC 468, the Apex court \\nconsidered a case where the High Court \\nhad issued directions to admit the students \\nwho had approached the writ Court,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'producer': 'PDFium', 'creator': 'PDFium', 'creationdate': 'D:20240909212839', 'source': 'Case-Test.pdf', 'total_pages': 4, 'page': 2, 'page_label': '3'}, page_content='2 All]                     Manoj Kumar Pandey and others V. State of U.P. and another 595\\nignoring the merit of the students who had \\nnot approached the Court.  \\n \\nThe Hon\\'ble Supreme Court \\nobserved as under:-  \\n \\n\"The High Court should have \\ndirected only two students to be admitted \\nand that too on merit. Admittedly, there \\nwere more meritorious students than the \\nrespondents, waiting in queue. The High \\nCourt, thus, travelled beyond its \\njurisdiction and not only directed more \\nstudents than the institute could absorb \\nbut also students who were less \\nmeritorious, to be admitted. No reasons \\nwhatsoever have been given by the High \\nCourt for exercising its extraordinary writ \\njurisdiction so peremptorily which has \\nresulted in injustice, both to the appellant-\\ninstitution as well as to the students who \\nstood higher in merit than all most all the \\nrespondent- students. We refrain from \\nmaking any further comment on the \\nimpugned judgment.\"  \\n \\n6.  Similarly, general directions were \\nissued to give benefit to the students \\nstrictly in accordance with the merit, in \\nSrawan Kumar & Ors Vs. Director \\nGeneral of Health Services & Ors, 1993 \\n(Supp) 1 SCC 632. In K.C. Sharma & \\nOrs. Vs. Union of India & Ors., (1997) 6 \\nSCC 721, a Constitution Bench of the \\nHon\\'ble Supreme Court has considered \\nthe aspect of giving benefit to a particular \\nperson and refusal to grant such benefit \\nby the High Court to other similarly \\nsituated only on the ground that they had \\napproached the Court at a belated stage. \\nThe Apex Court held that in such a case \\nthe judgement has to be rendered in rem \\nand benefit of the judgment should be \\ngiven to all other similarly situated \\npersons.  \\n7.  However as seen above, the \\nSupreme Court in Sheo Shyam & Ors \\n(Supra) restricted the relief to 11 \\nappointments only. In this view of the \\nmatter we would not be justified in \\ngranting any relief to the petitioners. This \\napart, it must also be noticed that no \\nspecific averment has been made by the \\npetitioners that their names were included \\nin the waiting list. All that they have \\nstated is that they expect that their names \\nwould be included in the waiting list.  \\n \\n8.  Further the present petitioners \\nhave filed this writ petition only in \\nSeptember, 2002 much after the expiry of \\none year from the date when the last \\nrecommendation was made on 26th July, \\n2001. This petition has been filed after the \\nlife of the waiting list came to an end. It is \\nsettled legal proposition that no relief can \\nbe granted to the candidate if he \\napproaches the Court after expiry of the \\nSelect List. (Vide J. Ashok Kumar Vs. \\nState of Andhra Pradesh & Ors., JT \\n(1996) 3 SCC 225; State of Bihar & Ors. \\nVs. Md. Kalimuddin & Ors., AIR 1996 \\nSC 1145; State of U.P. & Ors. Vs.

Vs. \\nRam Swarup Saroj, (2003) 3 SCC 699). It \\nhas been held therein that if the selection \\nprocess is over, select list had expired and \\nappointments had been made, no relief \\ncan be granted by the Court at a belated \\nstage.  \\n \\n9.  The Hon\\'ble Apex Court while \\nconsidering the case has granted relief \\nonly to those persons who had approached \\nthe Court and those were the persons who \\nhad filed the writ petition before this \\nCourt within one year from the date on'),\n",

Therefore, those persons had \\napproached the Court when the select \\nlist/merit list was alive. The case of the \\npetitioners is quite distinguishable as they \\nhave approached this Court after more \\nthan two months of the expiry of the \\nselect list. Therefore, petitioners cannot \\nclaim the relief which had been granted to \\nother persons by the Hon\\'ble Apex Court.  \\n \\n10.  If some person has taken a relief \\nfrom this Court by filing a Writ Petition \\nimmediately after the cause of action had \\narisen, petitioners cannot take the benefit \\nthereof by filing a writ petition belatedly. \\nThey cannot take any benefit thereof at \\nsuch a belated stage for the reason that \\nthey cannot be permitted to take the \\nimpetus of the order passed at the behest \\nof some diligent person.  \\n \\n11.  In State of Karnataka & Ors. Vs. \\nS.M. Kotrayya & Ors., (1996) 6 SCC 267, \\nthe Hon\\'ble Supreme Court rejected the \\ncontention that a petition should be \\nconsidered ignoring the delay and laches \\non the ground that he filed the petition \\njust after coming to know of the relief \\ngranted by the Court in a similar case as \\nthe same cannot furnish a proper \\nexplanation for delay and laches. The \\nCourt observed that such a plea is wholly \\nunjustified and cannot furnish any ground \\nfor ignoring delay and laches.   \\n \\n12.  Same view has been reiterated \\nby the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court in Jagdish \\nLal & Ors. Vs. State of Haryana & Ors., \\nAIR 1997 SC 2366, observing as under:-  \\n \\n\"Suffice it to state that appellants \\nmay be sleeping over their rights for long \\nand elected to wake-up when they had \\nimpetus from Veerpal Chauhan and Ajit \\nSingh\\'s ratio.... desperate attempts of the \\nappellants to re-do the seniority, held by \\nthem in various cadre.... are not amenable \\nto the judicial review at this belated stage. \\nThe High Court, therefore, has rightly \\ndismissed the writ petition on the ground \\nof delay as well.\"  \\n \\n13.  In M/s. Roop Diamonds & Ors. \\nVs. Union of India & Ors., AIR 1989 SC \\n674, the Hon\\'ble Supreme Court \\nconsidered a case where petitioner wanted \\nto get the relief on the basis of the \\njudgment of the Supreme Court wherein a \\nparticular law had been declared ultra \\nvires. The Court rejected the petition on \\nthe ground of delay and latches observing \\nas under:-   \\n \\n\"There is one more ground which \\nbasically sets the present case apart. \\nPetitioners are re-agitating claims which \\nthey have not persued for several years. \\nPetitioners were not vigilant but were \\ncontent to be dormant and close to sit on \\nthe fence till somebody else\\'s case came \\nto be decided.\"  \\n \\n14.  Thus, petitioner was not entitled \\nto claim any benefit of the said judgment \\nof this Court.  \\n \\n15.  In view of the above, we are of \\nthe considered opinion that no relief can \\nbe granted to the petitioners. Petition \\nlacks merit and is accordingly dismissed.  \\n---------')]"
